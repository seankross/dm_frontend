              People with Master's and Ph.D. degrees in engineering often work in industry (such as Microsoft) or in academia (colleges and universities). <br><br>
              Suppose you are looking at the results of a salary survey. Note: everyone surveyed is either is working in either industry or academia.

            Later on in this task you will be asked how much you would be willing to pay for a virtual good in an online game. For now, let's say you are considering buying a new product called a widget as part of such a game.
          </p><p>
            We will ask you, for each of the possible prices listed below, to please indicate whether you would be willing to:</p>
            <ol>
              <li>
                Pay that amount of money and get the widget
              </li>
              <li> Not buy the widget at this price.
              </li>
            </ol>

            <p>
              After you have finished, one of the prices listed below will be selected at random as the price for the widget. If you have indicated you would buy at this price, you will receive the widget and pay this amount of money. If you have indicated that you would not buy a widget at this price, then nothing will happen.
            </p><p>
              Notice the following two things: <ol><li>
                Your decision can have no effect on the price of the widget because the price will be selected at random.
              </li>
              <li> It is in your interest to indicate your true preferences at each of the possible prices listed below.</li>
            </ol>
          </p>
          <p>
            Let's say you were willing to pay at most $3 for the widget. Then you would check the button for 'buy' at the prices of $1, $2, and $3. You would check the button for 'not buy' for the prices of $4 and $5.</p><p>

              To verify that you understand this process, please fill out the form below assuming that you are willing to pay at most $4 for the widget.	</p>

              You are an athlete in the up and coming sport of boulder sliding, where the goal is to slide your boulder farther than your competitor's boulder.
            </p><p>
              You are heading into a championship match against another athlete named Blorg.
            </p><p>
              In the championship match, you and Blorg each have one chance to slide your respective boulders.
            </p><p>
              Whoever slides their boulder farther wins 250 Ice Dollars.

            </h3></b>
            <p>
              There is a special boulder you can rent that tends to slide farther than the standard boulder that Blorg will use.
            </p><p>
              It is perfectly within the rules for you to rent this boulder.
            </p><p>
              <b>
                You can be certain that Blorg WILL NOT rent a special boulder.
              </b>
            </p><p>
              However, the rental is good for only one use and it is not free.
            </p><p>
              We’re going to ask you how much you would be willing to pay for the special boulder, but before we do you’ll see some statistics to aid in your decision.
