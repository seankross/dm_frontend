              <p>
                People with master's and Ph.D. degrees often work in either industry (companies) or in academia (colleges and universities)
                <br><br>
                Imagine you were presented with the following two charts that show information about the salaries that people earn in different work settings and with different degrees. The charts were generated from a salary survey. The points in each chart show average salaries and the bars represent margins of error (95% confidence intervals) around the averages.

                <span class="number-cond">
                  It contains survey responses from 2100 people with master’s degrees (1800 who work in industry and 300 who work in academia) and 900 people with PhD degrees (300 who work in industry and 600 who work in academia).

                  Given the trends in the two charts, is it possible that these two charts are made up of the exact same data, just grouped differently?

          <span style="font-weight: bold">It turns out that these two charts are made up of the exact same data, just grouped differently.</span> That is, 3,000 people’s salaries are represented in the left graph and the same 3,000 people’s salaries are represented in the right graph.
          <br><br>
          It is sometimes considered a <span style="font-weight: bold">paradox</span> that that people with master's degrees make more money than people with PhD, on average, while at the same time, people with PhDs make more money than people with master's both inside industry and inside academia?

          Even if you have no idea how it's possible, we want you to guess something (do not say "I don't know"), even if you feel it is wrong. We would like a few sentences of explanation.
