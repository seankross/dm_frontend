Imagine that you are an analyst working for a thinktank. You conducted a survey
with 3,000 respondents in June 2018.

Each respondent worked in either industry (companies) or academia (colleges and universities) at the time of the survey. Also, each respondent had either a master's or a PhD degree.


Each of the 3,000 respondents reported:

* Work setting: Whether they worked in academia or industry at the time of the survey.
* Degree: Their current education level (master's or phd degree).
* Their current annual salary.

Your job is to infer the impact of work settings and degrees on salaries from this survey. Therefore you created two charts, shown below, to inspect data from all 3,000 respondents. The points in each chart show average salaries and the bars represent margins of error (95% confidence intervals) around the averages.
